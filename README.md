# Bevy Pathfinder

Pathfinding looked like a fun project. Figured I'd use it to learn Bevy.

## How to run
`cargo run`

WASD to move


## Done So Far

1. `Player` you can move with rotation
1. Grid setup
1. Determine `Player` `Current Tile`
1. Animate tile on `Player` enter


## Roadmap

1. Trap `Player` in box
1. Create `End Tile`
1. Calcuate `Path` to `End Tile` for `Player` from `Current Tile`
1. Light up `Path`
1. On tile enter, recalc `Path`
1. Light up visited tiles for `Path` search algorithm
1. Allow adding `Walls` with mouse
1. Allow adding `Slow Tiles`
1. Refactor
1. Polish
1. Compile to WASM and host
1. Bonus? (Camera Move, infinite scroll-ish)
