# Bevy Pathfinder (aka Paint By Algorithms)

Pathfinding looked like a fun project. Figured I'd use it to learn Bevy.

## How to run
`cargo run`

WASD to move

J - to pulse pathfinding


Algorithms (Press Number to paint with)
1 - Djikstra
2 - AStar
3 - AggressiveStar

## Roadmap

1. Show `Path`
1. Allow adding `Walls` with mouse
1. Allow adding `Slow Tiles`
